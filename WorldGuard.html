<h2 style="font-family:Readex Pro">How it works:</h2>
	<h3 style="font-family:Readex Pro">What does it do?</h3>
	<p style="font-family:Roboto">
		<a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard">WorldGuard</a> will stop others from interacting with your base. 
		This means that it would be virtually impossible for an unauthorized player to grief the area. 
	</p>
	<h3 style="font-family:Readex Pro">So.. just grief protection?</h3>
	<p style="font-family:Roboto">
		False. You will additionally be given the option to disable pvp, tnt damage, flint and steel, block trampling, 
		snow and ice control among <a href="https://worldguard.enginehub.org/en/latest/regions/flags/#flag-listing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other things</a>.
	</p>
<h2 style="font-family:Readex Pro">How to enable it:</h2>
	<h3 style="font-family:Readex Pro">Step 1:</h3>
	<p style="font-family:Roboto">
		Although I am a strong believer in freedom and equality, due to the fact that chests were immediately looted once we swithced the protection plugin, 
		I am not trusing players with claiming plots without admin intervention. This means that you will have to contact <b>noob_gamr</b> for your base
		protected. Other trusted mods may be added in future to allow for faster plot claiming and protection.
	</p>
<h2 style="font-family:Readex Pro">While you are waiting:</h2>
	<p style="font-family:Roboto">
		Due to the time difference, mods and admins may not always be online, meaning that it could take <b>up to 24 hours</b> for changes to be 
		approved and applied. However, there are things you could do to make the WorldGuard more secure.
	</p>
	<h3 style="font-family:Readex Pro">Close off your base:</h3>
	<p style="font-family:Roboto">
		In order for the WorldGuard to fully block players, make sure there aren't any structures for other players to climb onto and absail 
		down into your base. Although WorldGuard would stop them from breaking or placing blocks in your base, they may be stuck in your base, 
		which would be quite awkward in my opinion. I also recommend blocking players from entering at all, as it just gives them more of a chance 
		to steal from you.

	<h3 style="font-family:Readex Pro">Lock your chests:</h3>
	<p style="font-family:Roboto">
		This should be common sense, but some don't. <b>PLEASE REMEMBER TO <a href="LockettePro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LOCK YOUR CHESTS.</a></b> 
		A mod/admin will not return your items if they were left in an unlocked vanilla chest. 
	</p>

	<h3 style="font-family:Readex Pro">Lock your doors:</h3>
	<p style="font-family:Roboto">
		This is similar to closing off your base, but it is essential to security to lock your door. I have no doubt that a lot of potential robbers would 
		be more enticed if he came across an unlocked door. So, <b>please <a href="LockettePro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lock your doors.</b>
